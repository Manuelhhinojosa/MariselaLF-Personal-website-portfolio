# Artist & academic's website and blog

This project is a fully functional website/blog developed for a client, utilizing the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node). The front end, created with React, offers a dynamic and responsive user experience, while the back end, built with Express and Node, ensures robust and efficient server-side operations. MongoDB is employed for the database to store all content and user information. For image storage, Cloudinary is integrated, providing seamless and efficient media management. Communication between users and the client is facilitated through emailjs, enabling direct interaction via email. This comprehensive solution provides a smooth and engaging platform for users to read, interact, and communicate.
